# TerGific

## Overview:
In this assignment, I used the Giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. There are sample buttons in an array that you can click on to see the container populate with responses from the API call made to Giphy. The call requests the top 20 gifs with a rating of PG or below. To reduce load times, the gifs are not animated on load, only on click, and off when clicked again. You may type your own search into the form field at the top, and a button will be dynamically generated to populate the array of searches below. If I could communicate exclusively via gif, I think the world would be a better place, lol. Have fun!!

## Technologies Used: 
GIPHY API / AJAX
JavaScript 
jQuery 
HTML5
CSS3
Bootstrap

### Bonuses:
It's totally responsive
And it uses the correct Giphy branding per their guidelines. I love a good brand bible.
